I'm a backend-focused **Software Engineer** based in the Philippines, driven by a curiosity to understand complex systems and the desire to build solutions that actually matter.

Whether it's designing highly concurrent APIs or optimizing database bottlenecks, I enjoy bringing order to chaotic codebases. Recently, I've been fascinated by integrating AI into robust applications.

My primary toolkit includes **TypeScript (Next.js)**, **Python (FastAPI)**, and occasionally **C# (.NET Ecosystem)**. Off the clock, I'm likely trying to expand my project scopes. Especially if I stumble into an challenging idea that fascinates me, you'd find me architecting my nights away.

Currently, I'm working on [FutureThink Edge](https://www.futurethinkedge.org/) with a corporate account, an AI-powered EdTech startup for neurodivergent students, where I help scale their core backend infrastructure.

### ⚡ Out of Office

* 🎮 I play an unhealthy amount of video games... which inevitably leads to a perpetually growing reading and gaming backlog.
* ☕ I often fuel my late-night coding binges with entirely too much caffeine and a stubborn refusal to sleep.
* 🎨 I do some art here and then during long down times.
* 💬 I'm always down to chat about the latest tech industry drama, new framework releases, or distributed systems.
* 😺 I like cats.
